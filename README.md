This is a small desktop application with a simple GUI that allows you to generate power curve map values for BeamNG .jbeam files. The application is built using Python and the Tkinter library for creating the graphical user interface.

## How It Works

The application takes a desired horsepower amount as input, which represents the desired horsepower value. It then converts the horsepower values into corresponding torque values using a mathematical formula. The generated torque values are displayed in the application's interface.
